Markdown examples (this is an h3 header)
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line. This first paragraph should be some detailed description
of your project, outlining what it does, why it exists and possibly what other packages it 
interacts with. It's a good idea to take some time to write this introduction, since it not only
helps others understand your project, but also helps you keep the project focussed on its original
goals. Well-defined software is easier to maintain and to understand than software that creeps.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Here's a code sample:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavour country!";
}
~~~

And here's an even better code sample, with syntax highlighting:

~~~{.python}
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~

### An h3 header ###

Here is a nested list, showing a list within a list, and a code block within a list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Here is some inline HTML:
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Header 1</th>
<th>Header 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>row 1, cell 1</td>
<td>row 1, cell 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>row 2, cell 1</td>
<td>row 2, cell 2</td>
</tr>
</table> 

### Final Notes ###

Don't just leave this example document here as your mainpage, otherwise your documentation is bad,
and you should feel bad. Woopwoopwoopwoopwoop!
